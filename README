Electricity monitoring of solar PV installation using kWh meter
---------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains AVR firmware and corresponding PC scripts to
monitor solar PV installations through kWh meters with an isolated S0
output.

It works as follows: The kWh meter sends a pulse on it's output every
N watthours, which is detected by the AVR. The AVR provides as simple
serial protocol to read out the amount of pulses detected, which is
used by the PC SW to draw graphs of the electricity production using
RRDtool.
